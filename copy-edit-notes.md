I mostly accepted the copyedit changes. The only ones I didn't are listed here

# Chapter 6

Pg 151: The suggested revision made it unclear whether he knew g1, or knew that he knew g1, so I reworded to avoid that.

Pg 163: I think 'What' at the start of the parenthetical aside was better.

# References

I've added dois for some articles that I was missing, and filled in where the missing citations were.

The one thing I disagreed on, and actually changed what I'd sent you, was how to handle papers that are up in EarlyView (or some similar program). I've listed these as "forthcoming". The copyeditors asked these to be updated with publication details, listing the year they went to EarlyView. (See https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phib.12314 as an example of this.)
    I didn't want to change these, because they'll eventually get a volume and page number, and it won't be the same year they went to EarlyView. I think it will be confusing to later readers if I cite this paper as 2023, and someone else cites it as 2026 (or whenever it makes it into print). I think having it be forthcoming, but listing the doi so people can look up when it was accepted, was the right thing to do. Previously I'd listed page numbers for these articles, because that's what is on the website. But this I think was a mistake. These articles don't all start on page 1. And it will be best for consistency with later authors to simply not include a page number.

I changed handle.net links to doi.org links. They both work, but this gives more consistency.
